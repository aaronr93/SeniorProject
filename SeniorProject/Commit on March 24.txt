WHAT I'VE DONE

1. Added subclassing for most Classes.
    This works by changing
    >   order["isCurrentlyAvailable"]
    to
    >   order.isCurrentlyAvailable
    It's pretty awesome. I did this for two reasons:
    a)  This might get around the break that happens when you upgrade to
        Xcode 7.3/Swift 2.2.
        I can't push the app to my phone without upgrading Xcode. :(
    b)  It's loads more efficient. Just look at the files in the PFObject Subclasses folder.

2. Changed Restaurants.
    a)  Improved location services for Restaurants.
    b)  Made it so the default Driver Side tab is Orders, not Restaurants.
    c)  Made it so the list of Restaurants on the Driver Side is a blacklist, not a whitelist.
    d)  Restaurants themselves are no longer saved to Parse.
        i.  Instead, a restaurant NAME, LOCATION, and DISTANCE are passed around.
        ii. You query based on Restaurant name, which you get from local restaurants,
            the list of which is provided by the PointsOfInterest:searchFor method.

3. Added an extension to PFGeoPoint allowing you to determine if a PFGeoPoint is near
    one or more other PFGeoPoints. This extension can be found in PointsOfInterest.swift.

4. Eliminated extra Database calls. We would have run out of DB hits in no time!
    Along with this, I refactored a bunch of code (mostly as a result of my "projects").
    All my projects I started coupled with the subclassing means almost every file changed, haha.

5. More things that I've definitely forgotten about. Many hours, man...many hours. Many.                many.


WHAT I'M DOING

1. Fix location for restaurants to work 90% of the time. Right now it's at like, 50%.
    It doesn't break though.

2. Get our app working with Xcode 7.3/Swift 2.2. We need to be able to demo on an iPhone

3. Fixing all the tests I inevitably broke

4. Fixing all the bugs that will inevitably show up, regardless of what I do
    LET ME KNOW before writing up a bug, it might be an in-progress thing.
    I know that the query for My Orders / Orders to pick up isn't returning correct results.
